// Many Material Design widgets need to be inside of a MaterialApp to display properly, in order to inherit theme data.
// Therefore, run the application with a MaterialApp.
//
// The MyAppBar widget creates a Container with a height of 56 device-independent pixels with an internal padding of 8 pixels, both on the left and the right.
// Inside the container, MyAppBar uses a Row layout to organize its children. The middle child, the title widget, is marked as Expanded,
// which means it expands to fill any remaining available space that hasnâ€™t been consumed by the other children.
// You can have multiple Expanded children and determine the ratio in which they consume the available space using the flex argument to Expanded.
//
// The MyScaffold widget organizes its children in a vertical column. At the top of the column it places an instance of MyAppBar, passing the app bar a Text widget to use as its title.
// Passing widgets as arguments to other widgets is a powerful technique that lets you create generic widgets that can be reused in a wide variety of ways. Finally, MyScaffold uses an
// Expanded to fill the remaining space with its body, which consists of a centered message.
